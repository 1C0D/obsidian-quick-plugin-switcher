As you can see above, you can add groups to your plugins ( 7 colors )

you can then toggle plugins by group   

1 - Add group
  - using shortcut <kbd>1 to 7</kbd> and <kbd>0/del/suppr</kbd>, over each item
  - using context menu

you can see other the possible operations  

- you can add several groups(4 max) by plugin item  
  and then delete them <kbd>0/del/suppr</kbd>
