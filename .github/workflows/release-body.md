feature: takes notes on your community plugins
fix: new comm plugins with no info available are showing default infos and groups can be well added
feature: double touch (same double click) now supported and long click to open context menu should be natively ok. If not tell me so. So you can do all what you can do on desktop tablet version on mobiles too.
